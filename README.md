# Thanksgiving Dessert Game

### Instructions

This game is an adaptation of Crystal Collector, instead of crystals you have desserts! The player will have an unknown number to guess.
This is how you play:

There are four Thanksgiving desserts displayed as buttons on the page.
You will be shown a random number at the start of the game between 19 - 120.
 
When you click on a dessert, it will add a specific amount of points to the your total score. 
Each dessert has a different value between 1 - 12.

You wins if your total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
You lose if your score goes above the random number.

The game will restart whenever you wins or loss.
